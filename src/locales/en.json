    "5thQuestion": "How do you guarantee my orders arrive safely?",
    "5thAnswer": "Our main goal is to ensure we supply happy and healthy plants to our customers and so we have run multiple tests to ensure that our plants will arrive safe and sound. We use carefully thought out, recyclable packaging to keep your plants and pots secure on their journey and we also make sure the plants are as happy as possible when they leave us so we keep them watered and in a temperature-controlled environment. If your plant does look a little sad and droopy when it arrives with you, it should perk up after a good watering, but do make sure you do the finger-dip test first to check the moisture in the soil! Sometimes plants may also take a few days to acclimatise to a new environment so give it a few days to settle in, and if it drops a few leaves, this is completely normal.",
